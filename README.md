### Nail polish

Nail polish (also known as nail varnish or nail enamel) is a lacquer that can be applied to the human fingernail or toenails to decorate and protect the 
nail plates. The formula has been revised repeatedly to enhance its decorative effects and to suppress cracking or peeling. Nail polish consists of a mix of
 an organic polymer and several other components that give it colors and textures.[1] Nail polishes come in all shades of color and play a significant part 
in manicures or pedicures.






### Base coat

This type of nail polish is a clear, milky-colored, or opaque pink polish formula that is used specifically before applying nail polish to the nail.Its 
purpose is to strengthen nails, restore moisture to the nail, and help polish adhere to the nail. It prevents staining and extends the lifespan of the 
manicure.[13] Some base coats are marketed as "ridge fillers", and can create a smooth surface, de-emphasizing the ridges that can appear on unbuffed nails.
Some base coats, called "peel off base coats", allow the user to peel off their nail polish without using a remover.



### Top coat

This type of nail polish is a clear colored polish formula that is used specifically after applying nail polish to the nail.It forms a hardened barrier for 
the nail that can prevent chipping, scratching and peeling. Many topcoats are marketed as "quick-drying." Topcoats can help the underlying colored polish
dry quickly as well. It gives the polish a more finished and desired look and may help to keep the polish on longer.




### Gel  Nail polish

Gel polish is a long-lasting variety of nail polish made up of a type of methacrylate polymer. It is painted on the nail similar to traditional nail polish,
but does not dry. Instead it is cured under an ultraviolet lamp or ultraviolet LED. While regular nail polish formulas typically last two to seven days 
without chipping, gel polish can last as long as two weeks with proper application and home care.Gel polish can be more difficult to remove than regular nail
polish. It is usually removed by soaking the nails in pure acetone (the solvent used in most nail polish removers) for five to fifteen minutes,depending on
the formula.



### Matte  Nail polish

Matte polish is like regular polish, but has a purposely dull finish rather than a shine.It can be purchased as a regular base coat in ranges of differentcolors. 
Matte nail polish can also be found in a topcoat.Matte topcoat is most useful for painting over any dry base color, giving it a different appearance.
The matte topcoat polish will dull the shine from aregular base coat polish. Matte polish has become very popular through the years, particularly since it
can be used in nail art applications, where designcan be created on the nail using the contrast of both shiny and matte surfaces.
